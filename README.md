# IgorPlot
Matplotlib is a popular package for generating graphs in Python. The goal of this project is to provide a tool to convert a graph generated by matplotlib into a graph that can be modified in Igor Pro. Igor generally has a more powerful and intuitive user interface for graph customization, and it also integrates directly with the data source: changes in the source data are automatically reflected in the graph without having to manually regenerate it.

This project started from an Igor user's feature request: https://www.wavemetrics.com/forum/igor-pro-wish-list/converting-matplotlib-plots-igor-pro-graphs.

Note, as this is an actively developed project, many of matplotlib's features may not yet be convertible to Igor graphs. We're starting with simple line plots and moving forward from there.
